# Student-Grade-Calculator
The Student Grade Calculator is a Python-based console application designed to calculate a student’s grade based on marks entered by the user. The program validates user input, applies grading rules using decision-making logic, and displays encouraging feedback.

Project Goals:

1. To understand if–else decision-making.

2. To practice loops for repeated input.

3. To learn functions for modular code.

4. To handle invalid user input gracefully.

5. To apply Python concepts to a real-life grading system.
